## Chapter 1: Data Structures and Algorithms

### Data Structure
- **Definition**: Various ways to organize and structure data in a computer
- **Purpose**: Each type of data has efficient organizing rules
- **Types**:
  - Simple data structures: numbers, characters
  - Compound data structures: containers that store multiple data items together
- **Categories**:
  - Linear data structures
  - Non-linear data structures

### Algorithm
- **Definition**: A procedure/method/set of instructions to solve a problem
- **Formula**: Program = Data Structure + Algorithm
- **Properties**:
  - Input: Zero or more inputs exist
  - Output: At least one output exists
  - Definiteness: Instructions are clear and unambiguous

### Abstract Data Type (ADT)
- **Definition**: Data type defined abstractly
- **Characteristics**:
  - Only data and operations are defined
  - Implementation method is not specified
  - Focuses on core structure and behavior
- **Interface**: Only exposes the interface (information hiding)
- **Implementation**: More suitable to implement as a class

### Algorithm Performance
- **Factors**: Calculation speed, memory usage, functionality achievement
- **Priority**: Calculation speed is often prioritized
- **Measurement Challenges**:

  - Variable according to data

### Complexity Analysis
- **Purpose**: Analyze algorithm efficiency without actual implementation
- **Focus**: Analyze how execution time increases as input size n increases
- **Method**: Hardware and software environment independent evaluation
- **Time Complexity Function**: T(n) - number of operations as function of n

- **Circular Queue**:
  - Variables: front (before first element), rear (last element index)
  - Empty state: front == rear
  - Full state: front % M == (rear + 1) % M
  - Always keep one space empty to distinguish empty and full states

### Python Queue Module

- **Min/Max Search**: Follow leftmost/rightmost path
- **Insert**: O(log₂n) - follow search path, insert at failure point
- **Delete**: Most complex operation with 3 cases:
  - Case 1: Leaf node - simply remove
  - Case 2: One child - connect child to parent
  - Case 3: Two children - replace with successor

### BST Performance
- **Tree Shape Dependent**: Performance varies with tree structure
- **Balanced Tree**: O(log₂n) for all operations
