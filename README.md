# Data Structures

## 1. Data Structures and Algorithms
- Data Structure
    - Various ways to organize and structure data in computers
        - Each type of data has efficient organizing rules
        - Primitive data structure: numbers, characters
        - Composite data structure: containers storing multiple data items together
    - Composite data structures
        - Linear data structures
        - Non-linear data structures
- Algorithm
    - A set of procedures/methods/instructions to solve a problem
        - Program = Data Structure + Algorithm
    - Algorithm requirements
        - Input: Zero or more
        - Output: One or more
        - Definiteness: Instructions are clear and unambiguous
        - Finiteness: Must terminate after a finite number of steps
        - Effectiveness: Instructions are executable
    - Algorithm description methods
        - Natural language
        - Flowchart
        - Pseudo-code
        - Programming language
- Abstract Data Type (ADT)
    - Data type defined abstractly
        - Only the provided data and operations are defined
        - Implementation method is not defined
        - Focuses only on core structure and behavior
    - Only interface is exposed (information hiding)
    - More suitable to implement as a class
- Algorithm Performance
    - Computation speed, memory usage, functionality achievement
        - Computation speed is often prioritized
    - Measuring time is difficult
        - Implementation required
        - Use identical hardware and software environments
        - Variability depending on data
- Complexity Analysis
    - Analyze algorithm efficiency without actual implementation
        - Analyze how execution time increases as input size n increases
        - Evaluation method independent of hardware/software environment
    - Analyze the number of operations in the algorithm
        - Time complexity function T(n): express number of operations as a function of n
    - Big O notation
        - As n increases, the highest-degree term dominates
        - Other terms are relatively ignored
        - Only the highest-degree term is considered for time complexity
    - Big Omega
        - Indicates the lower bound of a function
    - Big Theta
        - Indicates both the upper and lower bounds with the same function
- Input Data
    - Execution time varies depending on input data
        - Best case, average case, worst case
        - Worst-case execution time is important: air traffic control, games, robotics

## 2. List & Set
- List / Linear List
    - Linear structure where items are arranged in order
        - Each item has an order/position
    - Insertion and addition possible at any position
    - List vs. Set
        - Whether there is an order among items
- List Implementation
    - Array structure
        - Used to create data of the same type together
        - Uses index operator [ ]
        - Items are located in contiguous memory: access time complexity O(1)
        - Difficult to change capacity, inefficient for operations in the middle (insert, delete, modify)
    - Linked structure
        - Uses links to know the next item's location
        - No guarantee that items are in adjacent memory: access time complexity O(n)
        - Easy to change capacity, efficient for insertions and deletions
- List Implementation Example
    - List ADT using Python
- List Applications
    - Line editor
        - i: Insert line. Add a line at a given row number with a string
        - d: Delete a line. Delete the line at a given row number
        - r: Replace a line. Change the content at a given row number with a string
        - p: Print current content. Print all lines with line numbers
        - l: Load file. Read lines from a specified file (test.txt)
        - s: Save file. Save edits to a specified file (test.txt)
        - q: Exit editor
- Set
    - Does not allow duplicate elements
    - No order among elements
- Set Implementation
    - Set ADT using Python

## 3. Stack
- Stack
    - Last-In First-Out (LIFO) data structure
        - Only the top of the stack can be used for insertion and deletion
        - The top can be the front or rear of a list
    - Simpler operations than lists due to restricted input/output
- Stack Applications
    - "Undo" feature in document editors
    - "Back" button in web browsers
    - System stack for complex function calls
    - Source code checker (parentheses matching)
    - Calculator (expression evaluation)
    - Maze solving
- Stack Implementation
    - Stack ADT using Python
- Stack Application Example
    - Parentheses checker

## 4. Queue & Deque
- Queue
    - First-In First-Out (FIFO) data structure
    - Insertion at the rear, deletion at the front
- Queue Applications
    - Buffer, call queue
    - Print job queue
    - Buffering (e.g., real-time video streaming)
    - Simulation (bank queues, airport runways, network packet modeling)
- Queue Implementation (Linear Queue)
    - Linear queue ADT using Python
- Queue Implementation (Circular Queue)
    - Uses separate variables for front and rear
    - Front: index before the first element
    - Rear: index of the last element
    - Empty state: front and rear are equal
    - Full state: front % M == (rear + 1) % M
    - One space is always left empty to distinguish between full and empty
    - Circular queue ADT using Python
- Queue Module
    - import queue
    - Provides queue and stack classes
- Queue Applications
    - Maze search (breadth-first search)
- Deque
    - Double-ended queue: insertion and deletion possible at both ends
        - More flexible than stack or queue
        - Can be used as stack or queue
    - Does not allow insertion or deletion in the middle
- Deque Implementation
    - Deque ADT using Python
- Deque Implementation (Circular Queue Inheritance)
    - Deque ADT using circular queue inheritance in Python
- Priority Queue
    - Queue with the concept of priority
    - All data has priority; higher-priority data is output first
    - Can behave as queue or stack depending on how priority is assigned
        - If earlier items have higher priority: behaves like a queue (FIFO)
        - If earlier items have lower priority: behaves like a stack (LIFO)
- Priority Queue Applications
    - Simulation
    - Network traffic control
    - OS job scheduling
    - Numerical computation
    - Applications (selecting high-priority candidates)
